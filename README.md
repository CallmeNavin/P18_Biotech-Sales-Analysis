# P18_Biotech Sales Analysis

**VERSION 1**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project analyzes the performance of a biotech company specializing in Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farming, producing Protein Meal, Insect Oil, and Organic Fertilizer.
- The objective is to identify operational gaps and provide actionable recommendations to improve production efficiency, biological performance, and product quality.

**B. Dataset Information**

_**Source**_

- A simulated dataset was created, since real-world datasets in this niche industry are rarely public.
- The dataset was designed to reflect realistic operations of BSF production, aligned with key KPIs (egg hatch, larvae survival, bioconversion, yield, protein %, lauric acid %).
- This also serves as a domain-focused case study, relevant to my application for a data role in the biotech/insect protein sector.

**_Period_**

- Data covers the period January 2024 ‚Äì February 2025.

**C. Methodology**

- Data Cleaning:
  + Column Type
  + %Blank
  + Outlier
- Export cleaned data & import to Power BI for visualizing and finding insights

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Key Findings**_

- Production Efficiency: Actual output is on average 15% below plan, indicating underperformance vs. production targets.
- Protein Content: ~44.8% (industry benchmark 40 to 50%), hence within the acceptable range.
- Bioconversion Rate: ~22% (industry benchmark 13 to 51%) ‚Üí within acceptable range, though not best-in-class.
- Larvae Survival Rate: ~75.1% (industry benchmark 90 to 99%), far below expected ‚Üí urgent need for process improvement.
- Egg Hatch Rate: ~82.2% (industry benchmark 92.1 to 97.5%), significantly lower ‚Üí highlights inefficiency in breeding management.
- Lauric Acid: ~32.1% (industry benchmark 32.4 to 57.4%), at the lowest edge of the range ‚Üí indicates suboptimal oil quality.

_**Actionable Plans**_

- Short-term goal:
  + Priority 1: Stabilize and improve larvae survival rate.
    - Root cause: Overcrowding, Inconsistent feed quality, Suboptimal temperature/humidity control
    - Method: Reduce rearing density, Standardized feed formulation, Standardize rearing conditions
    - Target: Improve survival rate to ‚â•85% within 3 months, aiming for ‚â•90% within 6 months.
  + Priority 2: Increase egg hatch rate by reviewing breeding density and adult fly management.
    - Root cause: High density of adult flies in breeding cages, Suboptimal temperature/humidity control
    - Method: Reduce rearing density, Standardize rearing conditions
    - Target: Increase hatch rate from 82% to ‚â•90% within 6 months.
‚Üí Output gap is a symptom caused by low hatch/survival rates. It will automatically improve once short-term priorities are addressed.
- Long-term goal:
  + Priority 1: Enhance lauric acid content in insect oil via substrate optimization, harvest timing, and improved processing methods.
    - Root cause: Suboptimal oil extraction method
    - Method: Optimize defatting/extraction process
    - Target: Raise lauric acid content from 32% to ‚â•40% within 12‚Äì18 months.
